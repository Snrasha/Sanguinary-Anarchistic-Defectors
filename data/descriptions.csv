SAD_shrike_rack,WEAPON,"A short-ranged tracking missile, launched from a triple-rack. Intended to bypass active defenses by virtue of overwhelming velocity.

Railgun assisted kinetic penetrator.  Potent Propulsion, but limited fuel capacity, giving almost no chance of recovery if the shot misses.  Effective primarily against shields.  It is fitted with a small explosive charge, which is set to go off when it impacts a targeted ships hull; while the damage to the hull is typically small, this can damage and disrupt shipboard systems.

This Sanguinary Anarchist modification increases the accuracy but reduces the explosive damage of the missile.",Close Support,,
SAD_shrike_pod,WEAPON,"A short-ranged tracking missile, launched from a magazine-fed dual pod. Intended to pierce active defenses by virtue of overwhelming velocity.

Railgun assisted kinetic penetrator.  Propulsion is very potent, but the fuel supply is quite limited, giving almost no chance of recovery if the shot misses.  Effective primarily against shields. It is fitted with a small explosive charge, which is set to go off when it impacts a targeted ships hull; while the damage to the hull is typically small, this can damage and disrupt shipboard systems.

SAD_cepc,WEAPON,"The CEPC, or Carried Energy Pulse Cannon, is a SRA weapon system capable of significant, if front loaded, damage.

Rather than fire the bolt through a typical lasing medium or projector, Shadowyards researchers opted to utilize a physical medium to act as a carrier for the energy pulse.  While the method has proven to be somewhat more efficient than many other methods and can produce highly damaging bolts, the Charge Carrier Medium (CCM) must be charged before firing, resulting in a limited capacity of available shots at any given time.  The CEPC's fire rate is more than sufficient for this to lead to noticeable drops in combat efficiency in fairly short time frames.

SAD_stopper1,WEAPON,"Sometimes, you need a Scatter CEPC for your phase ship.
This Stopper version of the Shamash does not bypass shields or damage engines, but inflicts true damage.",Close Support,,
SAD_pdcepc,WEAPON,"The Light variant of the CEPC is the SRA's most common dedicated CIWS system, focused on maintaining a high fire rate with excellent accuracy.

Cyclic loading chambers allow the weapon to maintain an extremely high rate of fire; charge carriers are small but capable of reasonable damage at short range.  High accuracy and limited engagement envelope leave it most effective for providing Close Weapons Support against enemy fighters and missiles.",Point Defense,,
SAD_mcepc,WEAPON,"The Medium CEPC is well liked amongst Shadowyards forces, well regarded as a reliable and deadly weapons platform, despite the high fitting requirements this advanced hardware requires.

Twin cannons ensure a high rate of fire with good accuracy while extended accelerator rails give it superior range.  An improved charging system allows it to fire larger CCM pellets safely, which has greatly improved the weapons damage at some cost in efficiency.

This Sanguinary Anarchist modification modifies the number of projectiles fired per shot.",Assault,,
SAD_wamgun,WEAPON,"Featuring distinctive crescent-bolts of energy, the 'Wavepulse' Cannon is a general-purpose, if exotic, weapon of war.

Ultimately a simple weapon, the Wavepulse is actually numerous smaller particle cannons, horizontally aligned firing in sequence to produce a much larger blast of energy.  Of only middling efficiency, the configuration of particle projectors is nevertheless quite effective at producing localized stress to shields and armor, and the weapon is noted for leaving distinctive 'scars' on damaged hull plating.  The resulting 'cutting' effect can on occasion inflict additional damage as a result of secondary stresses resulting from the unusual damage pattern.

This Sanguinary Anarchist modification increases the shot capacity of the weapon at a significant cost to damage output.",Close Support,,
SAD_mpolar,WEAPON,"The Polarizer is an energy weapon that delivers an modest electromagnetic pulse (EMP) charge. The polarizer carries its charges on a variant of the CEPC's carrier medium, which, in its highly charged state, becomes unstable; it also fires a shielded micro-sensor which detects hostile craft and causes the blast to explode, delivering its charge to targets within a short range.

As such the Polarizer sees a good deal of use as a general purpose close defense battery, though it remains useful in disabling enemy ships.

The medium version from the Sanguinary Anarchists always uses the same ammo, but has a higher fire-rate.",Special,,
SAD_stormBlaster,WEAPON,"The Stormblaster is a rotary energy weapon system with an extremely high rate of fire. With an insane ammo capacity, it can shoot for a long time before it runs out.
Particle masses become unstable after a short distance and tend to detonate spectacularly when near dense concentrations of matter, such as starships.  Though it's damage against shields and armor is middling at best, the Storm Blaster shines when engaging small craft or vessels with unprotected hull.",Close Support,,
SAD_slowbeamM,WEAPON,This unique weapon of Atan-Class is a Mono CAS Beam reduced for be usable for the Atan.,Close Support,,
SAD_slowbeamH,WEAPON,"The Break CAS Beam is a variant of the Deva CAS Beam, where the damage output is constant, but the impact is pretty weak.",Close Support,,

SAD_booster,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activates ancilliary thrusters as well as increasing main drive output, leading to a brief increase to maximum speed at the cost of flux.",Movement,Provides a brief boost to top speed.,
SAD_displacer,SHIP_SYSTEM,Teleports the ship forward in the direction it's traveling. The system slowly builds up to four charges which can then be expended in short order.,Movement,Teleports the ship forward in the direction it's traveling. The system can store up to four charges at once and generates flux when used.,
SAD_reservewing,SHIP_SYSTEM,"This ship system is exactly the same as the standard shipsystem, except that it does not deploy the extra fighters if they cost more than 15 OP. Always deploys 2 extra fighters except if the wing is a unique one.",Fighter,Deploys an extra 2 fighter craft that can fight for a short time before returning to the carrier. Does not deploy craft if the OP cost is greater than 15.,
SAD_siegemode,SHIP_SYSTEM,"While in use, this system improves shield and weapon efficiency as well as weapons range, but reroutes power from the thrusters  in the process, greatly impairing mobility.",Defensive,"Improves shield efficiency, weapon efficiency, and weapons range. Greatly reduces mobility.",
SAD_DisturbSystem,SHIP_SYSTEM,"This system uses the sensors to find weaknesses in enemy ships, increasing the damage they take by 25%. ",Offensive,"This system uses the sensors to find weaknesses in enemy ships, increasing the damage they take by 25%. ",
SAD_transform,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The Apis can switch between a high mobility mode, boosting engine performance by 50 percent, and a heavy assault mode, boosting range and recoil of weapons by 50 percent and reducing their flux cost by 50 percent.",Offensive,Switch between high mobility or heavy assault modes.,
SAD_wadjet_transform,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The Wadjet can switch between a high mobility mode, boosting engine performance by 50 percent, and a heavy assault mode, boosting range and recoil of weapons by 50 percent and reducing their flux cost by 50 percent.",Offensive,Switch between high mobility or heavy assault modes.,
SAD_flux_perf,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The Hapy can switch to a assault mode, boosting range by 15 percent and reducing flux costs by 50 percent, at the cost of engine performance.",Offensive,Switch between mobility or assault modes.,
SAD_BurnDrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,Temporarily engages a primary burn on the system travel drive of the ship. Provides a massive speed boost for a fixed time at the expense of being able to use shields.,Movement,Provides a massive speed boost at the expense of being unable to use shields.,
SAD_flare,SHIP_SYSTEM,Launches flares that distract the guidance systems of incoming missiles and PD weapons. The flares also track missiles and any missile impacting a flare will be destroyed.,Defensive,Launches flares to confuse the guidance systems of nearby enemy missiles. The flares are fast and actively track the missiles.,

SAD_Wadjet,SHIP,"While the Wadjet shares the Neriad's design, it has a few differences, most notable is the replacement of the Neriad's weapons with 2 CPEC mounts.
The goal of the Wadjet design is to be usable throughout the sector, both in space or planetary environments, like the Neriad.
It has also been upgraded with better thrusters for a higher top-speed and better frontal shielding. Due to these improvements, the cost of this fighter is twice that of the Neriad.",,,
SAD_Anuket,SHIP,"The Anuket-Class is a simple, inefficent bomber design, armed with two smalls Strike ASM missiles and nothing else.
",,,
SAD_Neith,SHIP,"The SAD utilised the blueprint of the Seski class corvette in designing this frigate. Upscaling from corvette to frigate has removed the weaknesses of the Seski and increased the offensive power and shipsystems of the Neith-class, however it has also resulted in a comparative loss of speed.",,,
SAD_Thoth,SHIP,"The Thoth class appears to have been modified from the blueprints of the Enlil-class. Designed for speed, it also combines an excellent shipsystem with the standard armor and skills of the original variant from the Yardies.",,,
SAD_Seshat,SHIP,"The Seshat-class carrier have be engineered by the Sanguinary Anarchists from the Morningstar-class blueprint. This is the basic, no-frills carrier of the SAD fleet.",,,
SAD_Hapy,SHIP,"The Hapy-class is an odd modification of the Yardie Southpaw-class frigate, with good frontal firepower.
Like many other Sanguinary Anarchist frigates, it has a Phase Skimmer shipsystem.",,,
SAD_Qadesh,SHIP,"The Qadesh-class was modified from the Cetus-class, due to the Sanguinary Anarchists only requiring light logistical support, this is their only freighter-class vessel.",,,
SAD_Tefnut,SHIP,"The Tefnut-class is a modification of the Semele-class, carried out for the same logistical reasons as the Qadesh-class freighter. The Semele was too large for the SAD's purposes but a tanker-class vessel was needed to support their operations.",,,
SAD_Hathor,SHIP,"The Hathor-class is a carrier born from modifications of the Yardie Delphi-class vessel. It is able to overclock fitted LPCs to produce two more fighters during combat, but cannot maintain this level of performance without overloading critical ship systems. ",,,
SAD_Ptah,SHIP,"The Ptah-class was engineered from the Tartarus-class, and shares the same ship system as its progenitor. Despite its strong firepower, it is often referred to as a ""Baby Tartarus"".",,,
SAD_Khonsu,SHIP,"The Khonsu-class is fast, with a powerful array of mounts and a good shipsystem. It is said to have been engineered through a combination of the Minarette-class and Inanna-class ships.
It is the jewel of the SAD fleet.",,,
SAD_Apis,SHIP,"The Apis-class is an elite destroyer, which cannot be compared to others ships. Designed from the blueprint of the Clade-class, it outperforms its peers.
It can switch between two modes for more versality - the system can be compared to that of the Tartarus, but does not include any defensive capacity.",,,
SAD_Imhotep,SHIP,"The Imhotep-class is a strong battlecarrier with a decent amount of firepower.
Made from the Skadi-class blueprint, it has the same shipsystem as the Hathor, where it can deploy two more fighters or bombers when needed.",,,
SAD_Maat,SHIP,"The Maat-class is a design that loosely follows that of the Delphi, pairing it with the defensive nature of the Tartarus. It lacks in firepower when compared to the Yardie Clade-class destroyer, but can take more punishment.
The built-in wave pulse of the Maat-class is a cost-saving measure, as producing the system separately would be more expensive.",,,
SAD_Owclaw,SHIP,"The Owclaw-class was designed by a deranged genius amongst the Sanguinary Anarchists, after they apparently witnessed a very similar ship in action. An expensive ship, lacking in point defence, its modus operandi is to overwhelm its opponents utterly. After all, the best defence is a good offence.",,,
SAD_Taweret,SHIP,"The Taweret-class is a complex monstrosity born from the combination of the Belet-Seri and other Shadowyards capitals. Capable of identifying the weaknesses of every hostile within sensor range, and destroying them just as easily. It administers the coup de grace to shieldless foes with the heavy Storm Blaster installed at the front of the ship.",,,
SAD_MotherShip,SHIP,"Nobody knows who made this monstrosity. All they know is that it has been made out of collected scrap parts from all Shadowyard ships that are currently in use.

Clearly not designed for offensive use, and lacking in power for a ship of this scale, the SAD have nonetheless fitted it with a stolen Nidhogger lance. The MotherShip is a dedicated support ship that is used as a mobile shipyard, to prepare for the future Sanguinary invasion.",,,
SAD_Atan_b,SHIP,"Atan-class is a ship so expensive and hard to made that everyone believes that the Anarchists have stolen these ships. This is probably the case. The Atan is a ship with insane speed, and the ability to switch to a defensive mode if it is overloaded or venting to reduce damage taken during this vulnerable period.
The ship system allows the vessel to redirect some of the power usually spent on propulsion to the weapon systems.

The Atan(B) is a damaged version with degraded engines and lacking the unique built-in weapon, which has been replaced with a chaingun.",,,
SAD_Atan,SHIP,"Atan-class is a ship so expensive and hard to made that everyone believes that the Anarchists have stolen these ships. This is probably the case. The Atan is a ship with insane speed, and the ability to switch to a defensive mode if it is overloaded or venting to reduce damage taken during this vulnerable period.
The ship system allows the vessel to redirect some of the power usually spent on propulsion to the weapon systems. This ship is rare, with only three intact models known.",,,
SAD_Niddhoggr,SHIP,"The Niddhoggr is a ship that was never meant to see the light of day. After all it started as a simple pipe dream that simply kept on being considered possible, as its makers saw how powerful such a ship could be in the middle of battle. Being one of the most impressive ships out there, it shouldn't surprise anyone that this ship is a logistical nightmare in peaceful times, because it is meant to fight or simply defend key locations. There are rumors that certain factions have stolen this design and simply added a new paintjob to it because SAD made that a lot easier than SRA ever did when they used these ships to intimidate other factions. Mining versions of this ship, as ridiculous as it sounds used to exist, but unfortunately all production chips for it were lost or seized by certain factions in order to prevent such ships from oversaturating markets with ore.
Niddhoggr is equipped with luxurious interior that leaves finest accomodations available in the Sector in dirt. It even has a tram system in order to get to different parts of the ship quickly, which means it's one of the craziest ships out there. Tram lines are used to carry things like ammunition to weapons and move crew from one place to another without having to walk, which speeds up all activities done by crew. Its massive array of thrusters allows it to perform manoeuvres which are so dangerous to the crew that some parts of the ship are entirely automated, so that crew won't be endangered. Another important fact about the Niddhoggr is that unknown to some, its originally was called Jörmungandr, which meant ""huge monster""  in Norse mythology.  Some random person decided to call it the Niddhoggr, since they thought a dragon/serpent who gnaws at the root of the world tree was more convincing when the original Jormungandr still had the original paintjob. Some still argue that this ship's true nature is connected to the infamous Unsung project which existed pre-Collapse, but most of that has changed since SRA dropped the design and SAD stole it from their scrap yards.
As a last note, if you see a Niddhoggr facing you in combat, face the opposite way and fly as far away as you can, if you want to survive the encounter of course. The chances one will ever fly one of these will only be reserved to those who fought for such once in a lifetime opportunity,  even that is an exaggeration. Very few ships of this class remain in combat-capable condition. If equipped properly it can wipe entire navies, but losing one in combat can result in the suicide of their owners because they often represent the only thing capable of surviving easily in this sector. Post-collapse, ships of this class represent a safe haven for those seeking a peaceful life filled with luxury and a surrounded by cold hard walls painted over with wacky colors to hide their space misery. If you ever capture a Niddhoggr, the best thing you can do is treat this massive object with massive respect. Chances are its older than anyone you know or even the gates themselves, some say. If you ever lose a Niddhoggr during combat, you might consider revisiting your resume as you will either be mutilated by the families of the dead crew members or thrown out the airlock for your incompetence. Fates worse than these were reported, but were quickly classified because of sheer amount of brutality and savagery that puts even most insane Pirate Warlords to shame.",,,
SAD_Babi,SHIP,"Nobody wants know why the Sanguinary Anarchists have made this Phase ship, which is a Shamash completely modified and probably only good for the scrap value of its hull.
However, the SAD like this ship, and that is all that is important to them.",,,
