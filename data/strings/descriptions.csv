SAD_shrike_rack,WEAPON,"A short-ranged tracking missile, launched from a triple-rack. Intended to bypass active defenses by virtue of overwhelming velocity.

Railgun assisted kinetic penetrator.  Propulsion is very potent, but fuel supply quite short, giving almost no chance of recovery if the shot misses.  Effective primarily against shields.  It is fitted with a small explosive charge, which is set to go off when it senses it is surrounded by a targeted ships hull; while the damage to the hull is typically small, this can damage and disrupt shipboard systems.

The modified version of the Sanguinary Anarchist increase the aiming but reduce the amount of explosive charge on the missile.",Close Support,,
SAD_shrike_pod,WEAPON,"A short-ranged tracking missile, launched from a magazine-fed dual pod. Intended to pierce active defenses by virtue of overwhelming velocity.

SAD_cepc,WEAPON,"The CEPC, or Carried Energy Pulse Cannon, is an SRA weapon system capable of significant, if front loaded, damage.

Rather than fire the bolt through a typical lasing medium or projector, Shadowyards researchers opted to utilize a physical medium to act as a carrier for the energy pulse.  While the method has proven to be somewhat more efficient than many other methods and can produce highly damaging bolts, the Charge Carrier Medium (CCM) must be charged before firing, resulting in a limited capacity of available shots at any given time.  The CEPC's fire rate is more than sufficient for this to lead to noticeable drops in combat efficiency in fairly short time frames.

The modified version of the Sanguinary Anarchist modify the number of projectile fired per the weapon.",Close Support,,

SAD_stopper1,WEAPON,"Sometimes, you need a Scatter CEPC for your phase ship.
This Stopper version of the Shamash do not pass shield or break the engine, but inflict true damage.",Close Support,,
SAD_pdcepc,WEAPON,"The Light variant of the CEPC is the SRA's most common dedicated CIWS system, focused on maintaining a high fire rate with excellent accuracy.

Cyclic loading chambers allow the weapon to maintain an extremely high rate of fire; charge carriers are small but capable of reasonable damage at short range.  High accuracy and limited engagement envelope leave it most effective for providing Close Weapons Support against enemy fighters and missiles.",Point Defense,,
SAD_mcepc,WEAPON,"The Medium CEPC is well liked amongst Shadowyards forces, well regarded as a reliable and deadly weapons platform, despite the high fitting requirements this advanced hardware requires.

Twin cannons ensure a high rate of fire with good accuracy while extended accelerator rails give it superior range.  An improved charging system allows it to fire larger CCM pellets safely, which has greatly improved the weapons damage at some cost in efficiency.

The modified version of the Sanguinary Anarchist modify the number of projectile fired per the weapon.",Assault,,
SAD_wamgun,WEAPON,"Featuring distinctive crescent-bolts of energy, the 'Wavepulse' Cannon is a general-purpose, if exotic, weapon of war.

Ultimately a simple weapon, the Wavepulse is actually numerous smaller particle cannons, horizontally aligned firing in sequence to produce a much larger blast of energy.  Of only middling efficiency, the configuration of particle projectors is nevertheless quite effective at producing localized stress to shields and armor, and the weapon is noted for leaving distinctive 'scars' on damaged hull plating.  The resulting 'cutting' effect can on occasion inflict additional damage as a result of secondary stresses resulting from the unusual damage pattern.

The SAD version increase the capacity of the weapon to shoot but lose insane damage on the process.",Close Support,,
SAD_mpolar,WEAPON,"The Polarizer is an energy weapon that delivers an modest electromagnetic pulse (EMP) charge. The polarizer carries its charges on a variant of the CEPCâ€™s carrier medium, which, in itâ€™s highly charged state, becomes unstable; it also fires a shielded micro-sensor which detects hostile craft and causes the blast to explode, delivering its charge to targets within a short range.

As such the Polarizer sees a good deal of use as a general purpose close defense battery, though it remains useful in disabling enemy ships.

The medium version from the Sanguinary Anarchist use always the same ammo, but with a high fire-rate.",Special,,
SAD_stormBlaster,WEAPON,"Rotary energy weapon system with an extremely high rate of fire. With a insane ammo magazine, it can shoot for a long time before run out.
Particle masses become unstable after a short distance and tend to detonate spectacularly when near dense concentrations of matter, such as starships.  Though it's damage against shields and armor is middling at best, the Storm Blaster shines when engaging small craft or vessels with unprotected hull.",Close Support,,
SAD_slowbeamM,WEAPON,This unique weapon of Atan-Class is a Mono CAS Beam reduced for be usable for the Atan.,Close Support,,
SAD_slowbeamH,WEAPON,"The Break CAS Beam is a modified weapon of Deva CAS Beam, where the damage output is constant, but the impact become pretty weak.",Close Support,,

SAD_booster,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activates ancilliary thrusters as well as increasing main drive output, leading to a brief increase to maximum speed at the cost of flux.",Movement,Provides a brief boost to top speed.,
SAD_displacer,SHIP_SYSTEM,Teleports the ship forward in the direction it's traveling. The system slowly builds up to four charges which can then be expended in short order.,Movement,Teleports the ship forward in the direction it's traveling. The system can store up to four charges at once and generates flux when used.,
SAD_reservewing,SHIP_SYSTEM,"This ship system is exactly the same than the standard shipsystem, except than it do not deploy extra fighter if they cost more than 15 OP. Deploy always 2 extra fighters except if the wing is a unique fighter.",Fighter,Deploys extra 2 fighter craft that can fight for a short time before returning to the carrier. Do not deploy craft if the OP cost is superior to 15,
SAD_siegemode,SHIP_SYSTEM,"While in use, this system improves shield and weapon efficiency as well as weapons range, but reroutes power from the thrusters  in the process, greatly impairing mobility.",Defensive,"Improves shield efficiency, weapon efficiency, and weapons range. Greatly reduces mobility.",
SAD_DisturbSystem,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The system uses the sensor to find weaknesses in enemy ships, increasing the damage they take by 25%. ",Offensive,"The system uses the sensor to find weaknesses in enemy ships, increasing the damage they take by 25%. ",
SAD_transform,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The Apis can switch between a high mobility mode, boosting engine performance by 50 percent, and a heavy assault mode, boosting range and recoil of weapons by 50 percent and reducing their flux cost by 50 percent.",Offensive,Switch between high mobility or heavy assault modes.,
SAD_wadjet_transform,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The Wadjet can switch between a high mobility mode, boosting engine performance by 50 percent, and a heavy assault mode, boosting range and recoil of weapons by 50 percent and reducing their flux cost by 50 percent.",Offensive,Switch between high mobility or heavy assault modes.,
SAD_flux_perf,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The Hapy can switch to a  assault mode, boosting range by 15 percent and reducing their flux cost by 50 percent. Otherwise, lost engine performance.",Offensive,Switch between mobility or assault modes.,
SAD_BurnDrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,Temporarily engages a primary burn on the system travel drive of the ship. Provides a massive speed boost for a fixed time at the expense of being able to use shields.,Movement,Provides a massive speed boost at the expense of being unable to use shields.,
SAD_flare,SHIP_SYSTEM,Launches flares that distract the guidance systems of incoming missiles and PD weapons. The flares also track missiles and any missile impacting a flare will be destroyed.,Defensive,Launches flares to confuse the guidance systems of nearby enemy missiles. The flares are fast and actively track the missiles.,

SAD_Wadjet,SHIP,"While Wadjets share the Neriad's design, they feature a few differences, most notably the replacement of it's primary weapons. Armed with 2 CPECs, mission profiles of Wadjet wings include general purpose, interception and escort duties. Usable everywhere in the Sector and atmosphere-capable like the Neriad, Wadjet wings have been upgraded with top-class engines, improving top speed and a better front shield generator. Thanks to the relative rarity of these wings and performance upgrades, the cost of these fighters is often double that of the standard SRA Neriad.",,,
SAD_Anuket,SHIP,"Not very effecient, the SAD-designed Anuket bomber wing is equipped with a pair of Strike ASM missiles and little else. Surprisingly cheap, and disposable.
",,,
SAD_Neith,SHIP,"A purpose-built combat frigate, the SAD utilized stolen blueprints of the Seski corvette in designing this ship. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.

Visually similar to the Seski it is based on, but up-scaled in design from corvette to frigate-sized. The upgrades the Neith possesses have removed the inherent weaknesses of the Seski from the design and has increased the offensive firepower of the ship and also features improved ship systems. However, it's increase in size from corvette to frigate also means it is slightly more sluggish than the Seski and because of that, the Neith-class suffers from a comparative loss of speed.",,,
SAD_Thoth,SHIP,"Designed with stolen blueprints of the Enlil, the Thoth-class is designed primarily for speed, combining an excellent ship system package with fairly standard armor plating. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.

Compared to Shadowyard industry standards for frigates and small craft, the Thoth-class is nimble, but is mediocre in most other respects.",,,
SAD_Seshat,SHIP,"Lacking in general functionality, the Seshat-class carrier was designed with stolen Morningstar blueprints. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.

Primarily an escort carrier, the Seshat is used to escort larger groups or provides refueling or strike packages for smaller SAD patrol fleets.",,,
SAD_Hapy,SHIP,"Designed with stolen blueprints of the Southpaw, the Hapy-class features good frontal firepower and similarly to many other frigates, it carries a Phase Skimmer ship system. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.
",,,
SAD_Qadesh,SHIP,"The Qadesh-class is a purpose-built freighter, designed with stolen Cetus blueprints. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.

Deciding that the Cetus was too large to comfortably fit into their limited logistical profile, compounded with the lack of a freighter, the SAD opted to design one themselves and it sacrifices some cargo-carrying capacity in exchange for ease of manufacture and dedicated transport of material from one staging post to the next.",,,
SAD_Tefnut,SHIP,"A purpose-built tanker, the Tefnut-class is designed with stolen Semele blueprints. However, much like the Qadesh, the Semele was deemed too large of a tanker to fit the SAD's logistical profile, and thus is downsized to a more manageable layout at a somewhat reduced fuel range. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.",,,
SAD_Hathor,SHIP,"A dedicated carrier, the Hathor-class retains a reserve of fighters for critical engagements. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.

Designed with stolen Delphi blueprints, this ship, much like the Imhotep contains cramped hangar bays. These allow the Hathor to carry extra, reserve fighters when needed and it can deploy two more Wadjet or Anuket wings for protracted engagements, but the extra tactical computation required to guide these craft tax the ship's flux pool and must be managed carefully.",,,
SAD_Ptah,SHIP,"The Ptah-class, often nicknamed by SAD crews as the ""Baby Tartarus"" retains the design's ship-system in question. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.

An earlier SAD creation, the Ptah was designed with stolen Tartarus blueprints. It has strong, offensive potential and serves as an attack-craft despite notable flaws in it's construction.",,,
SAD_Khonsu,SHIP,"A fast, strong ship with well-placed weapon mounts and good ship systems built into the hull, the Khonsu-class was designed with stolen blueprints of the Minarette and Inanna-class blueprints combined together into an entirely new, unique design all on it's own. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.

In terms of speed, firepower and defense, the Khonsu-class represents an effective combination of all three and are noted as a quality design in ship-building across the Sector at large.",,,
SAD_Apis,SHIP,"An elite destroyer, Apis-class ships share their design most closely with the Clade-class and indeed were designed with stolen blueprints of that ship. However, the Apis decidedly features performance upgrades and are better armed. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.

Capable of switching between two modes for more versatility, the systems onboard the Apis are comparable to the Tartarus system, but do not include defensive capacities and are geared primarily toward offense.",,,
SAD_Imhotep,SHIP,"A strong battlecarrier with a decent amount of firepower, the Imhotep-class was designed with stolen Skadi fleet carrier blueprints. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.

A compact, if cramped design to begin with, the Imhotep does carry space in it's hangars to carry an extra two fighters for extra support if the ship finds itself losing fighters to overwhelming opposition. Decently armed, these battlecarriers still serve best as support carriers for the SAD's Wadjet or Anuket wings and larger capital ships, while being small enough to not tax logistics heavily on the resource-strained SAD.",,,
SAD_Maat,SHIP,"A ship designed to follow the concepts provided by the enigmatic Delphi-class, combined with defenses equal to that of the Tartarus. The Maat-class features a built-in SAD-spec Wavepulse Cannon, to simplify manufacture and makes both the ship and the weapon less expensive than they would have otherwise been seperately. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.

In terms of firepower compared to comparable SRA designs such as the Clade, it is lacking, but where offensively it fails, the Maat-class succeeds in strong defensive capabilities, serving as heavy, reliable escorts.",,,
SAD_Owclaw,SHIP,"Designed by a crazed, proclaimed genius amongst the Sanguinary Anarchist Defectors, the Owclaw-class appeared after they witnessed a very similar ship in action in the Sector and subsequently designed this capable cruiser. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.

An expensive ship that lacks in point-defense systems, the Owclaw's modus operandi is to overwhelm its opponents in a direct engagement. Most crews who serve aboard these ships believe in the ancient saying that the best defense is a good offense, a statement not entirely dissuaded by the Owclaw's status as a frontline combat vessel and its straight-forward, brutalist layout.",,,
SAD_Taweret,SHIP,"A complex and poorly-recognized capital ship, the Taweret-class was designed with stolen blueprints of the Belet-Seri and other capital ships. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.

Capable of finding and exploiting most weaknesses in the enemy's battlelines and containing several layers of armor, the Tarawet is most dangerous and effective against armored or shield-less targets. The Storm Blaster installed on the front of the ship is usually enough to overwhelm most armor plating, and is enough to support it's escorts with heavier-than average firepower.",,,
SAD_MotherShip_2,SHIP,"An improved and decidedly cleaner version of the MotherShip visually, this modified variant is still considered a monstrosity, both by the SAD and the wider Sector at large.

A monstrosity, the SAD MotherShip appears to have been constructed out of collected scrap and parts from Shadowyard spacecraft of all sizes, most of which are currently in use in their Navy. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.

Lacking in power for a ship of its size, the MotherShip was not however designed for offensive use, rather it serves as a defensive bulwark and a mobile base for SAD agents to secure their domain. Although the SAD have stolen the blueprints of the Nidhögger Lance and included it in the design, the MotherShip is primarily a dedicated support ship that is also used as a mobile shipyard. The SAD uses these defensive platforms to prepare for future Sanguinary invasion operations and expansion in the Sector.",,,

SAD_Atan_b,SHIP,"A downgraded variant for improved ease of production, the Atan(B)-class has reduced thruster output and lacks the built-in weapon hardpoint, which has been replaced with a chainGun instead. Only one confirmed sighting of this variant of the Atan has been confirmed by the Sector at large, puzzling many military analysts observing the Sanguinary Anarchistic Defectors and their movements. Unlike most ships, the Atan(B) lacks the traditionally bright colors of the SAD, which further makes the Atan(B) difficult to detect or spot visually.

A highly expensive and difficult ship to produce, the Atan-class is most likely a highly advanced and stolen pre-production prototype from Shadowyards, painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.

A rarely seen craft with only three confirmed sightings by the Sector at large, the Atan-class appears to be a fast-attack gunboat with powerful thrusters and variable-sweep geometry in its atmospheric wings, which double as armor plating as it can switch into defensive mode if overloaded and venting. This reduces damage taken and the chance for casualties and thanks to its high speed and destroyer-grade generator, the ship system hardwired into the Atan also permits it to redirect some of the flux output from the engines to weapon systems.",,,

SAD_Niddhoggr,SHIP,"Never meant to see the light of day, the Niddhoggr-class started as a simple pipe dream that was considered possible in theory, and so its designers pursued that goal as its makers saw how powerful such a ship could be in the middle of battle. One of the most impressive examples of SAD ship design in the Sector, it shouldn't surprise anyone then that this ship is a logistical nightmare in times of peace or inactivity, because it is meant to fight constantly or simply defend key locations. It is also painted in the traditionally bright colors of the SAD.

There are rumors that certain factions have stolen this design and simply added a new paintjob to it, largely because the SAD has made intimidating their foes a lot easier than the SRA ever has when used against other factions. Mining versions of this ship, as ridiculous as it sounds used to exist, but unfortunately all production chips for these examples were lost or seized by certain hostile powers in order to prevent such ships from over-saturating markets with ore.

The Niddhoggr is equipped with a luxurious interior that puts even the finest accommodations available in the Sector to shame. It even possesses a tram system, which facilitates crew and ammunition transport and speeds up inner ship logistics both during battles and in between them. Its massive array of thrusters allows it to perform impressive maneuvers, but the lack of safety controls means that some of these movements are so dangerous to the crew aboard that some parts of the ship are entirely automated, to avoid endangerment and casualties. Originally known as the Jörmungandr-class (named after a great serpent in Norse mythology), it was reborn after some consideration as the Niddhoggr, since some still argue that this ship's true nature is connected to the infamous Unsung project from the pre-Collapse era. However, most of that has changed since the SRA dropped the design and SAD shipwrights have stolen it from orbital wrecking yards.

Very few ships of this class remain in combat-capable condition and it remains one of the rarest vessels in the SAD's entire arsenal. Post-Collapse, ships of this class often represent a safe haven for those spacers seeking a peaceful life filled with luxury and surrounded by cold, hard walls painted over with the traditionally bright colors of the SAD to escape from the abject reality of life in the post-Collapse Sector.",,,
SAD_Babi,SHIP,"Well liked by Sanguinary crews, the Babi-class is a phase frigate based on the Shamash blueprint, and is entirely overhauled and modified to current specifications. While still using Phase Anchor technology from the Domain era, intelligent captains often pair these with other phase skimmers and harasser-type craft to maximize effectiveness, and these ships excel in groups to cover for several design flaws in the manufacturing process.

Unlike most ships, the Babi lacks the traditionally bright colors of the SAD, which further makes the Babi difficult to detect or spot visually.",,,
